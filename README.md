# 🖌️ Virtual White Drawing Board using Streamlit & Tkinter

This project is a **virtual white drawing board** built with Python, combining the power  for interface handling and **Tkinter** for graphical representation. It replicates the experience of sketching on a digital canvas — similar to apps like SketchUp.

Users can draw freely on the canvas and save their sketches as `.png` images. The project also includes essential assets required to run the app.

## ✏️ What is Tkinter?

> **Tkinter** is Python’s standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) library. It provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications and is widely used for desktop-based tools.
